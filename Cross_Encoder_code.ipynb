First, you have to get it, then make sure \\nyou don’t forget  it.  It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the \\nlatest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, \\nlearning  takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.\\nSome of the Head First learning principles:\\nMake it visual. Images are far more memorable than words alone, and make learning much \\nmore effective (up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). It also makes things \\nmore understandable.  Put the words within or near the graphics they \\nrelate to, rather than on the bottom or on another page, and learners will be up \\nto twice  as likely to solve problems \\nrelated to the content.\\nUse a conversational and personalized style. In recent \\nstud', 'ies, students performed up to 40% better on post-learning \\ntests if the content spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, \\nconversational style rather than taking a formal tone. Tell stories \\ninstead of lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t take yourself too \\nseriously. Which would you pay more attention to: a stimulating \\ndinner party companion, or a lecture?\\nGet the learner to think more deeply. In other words, \\nunless you actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in \\nyour head.  A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw \\nconclusions, and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need challenges, exercises, \\nand thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the brain \\nand multiple senses.\\nGet—and keep—the reader’s attention. We’ve all had the “I really want to \\nlearn this but I can’t stay awake past page one” e', 'xperience. Your brain pays attention \\nto things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. \\nLearning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain \\nwill learn much more quickly if it’s not.\\nTouch their emotions. We now know that your ability to remember \\nsomething is largely dependent on its emotional content.  You remember \\nwhat you care about.  You remember when you feel something. No, we’re not talking \\nhe\\nart-wrenching stories about a boy and his dog. We’re talking emotions like surprise, \\ncuriosity, fun, “what the...?” , and the feeling of “I Rule!” that comes when you solve a \\npuzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize you know something \\nthat “I’m more mathematically inclined than thou” Bob from class doesn’t .\\nS\\nRed\\nBlackWe have absolutely \\nnothing in common. \\nWe’re exclusive events\\nx1\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', 'you are here 4   xxxithe intro\\nMetacognition: thinking about thinking\\nI wonder how \\nI can trick my brain \\ninto remembering \\nthis stuff...If  you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more \\ndeeply , pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.\\nMost of  us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we \\nwere growing up. We were expected to learn, but rarely taught to learn.\\nBut we assume that if  you’re holding this book, you really want to learn statistics. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of  time. If  you want to use what you read in this book, you need to remember what you read. And for \\nthat, you’ve got to understand it. To get the most from this book, or any book \\nor learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on this \\ncontent. \\nThe trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as \\nReally Important. Crucial', 'to y\\nour well-being. As important as a tiger. \\nOtherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.\\nSo just how \\nDO you get your brain to treat statistics \\nlike it was a hungry tiger?\\nThere’s the slow, tedious way , or the faster, more effective way . The \\nslow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you are able to learn \\nand remember even the dullest of  topics if  you keep pounding the same thing into your \\nbrain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t feel important to him, but he \\nkeeps looking at the same thing over and over and over, so I suppose it must be.”\\nThe faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different \\ntypes of  brain activity . The things on the previous page are a big part of  the solution, \\nand they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For \\nexample, studies show that pu', 'tting words within the pictures they describe (as opposed to \\nsomewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to \\nmakes sense of  how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. \\nMore neurons firing = more chances for your brain to get that this is something worth \\npaying attention to, and possibly recording.\\nA conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they \\nperceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up \\ntheir end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily care that the “conversation” \\nis between you and a book! On the other hand, if  the writing style is formal and dry , your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful \\nof  passive attendees. No need to stay awake.\\nBut pictures and conversational style are just the beginning…\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', 'xxxii   introhow to use this book\\nHere’s what WE did:\\nWe used pictures, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s \\nconcerned, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.\\nWe used redundancy, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media types, \\nand multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of  your brain. \\nWe used concepts and pictures in unexpected ways because your brain is tuned for novelty , \\nand we used pictures and ideas with at least some emotional content, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of  emotions. That which causes you to feel something is more likely to be remembered, even if  that feeling is nothing more than a little humor, surprise, or interest.\\nWe used a', 'personalized, conversational style , because your brain is tuned to pay more \\nattention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if  it thinks you’re passively listening \\nto a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re reading.\\nWe included more than 80 activities, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you do things than when you read about things. And we made the exercises challenging-yet-do-able, because that’s what most people  prefer.\\nWe used multiple learning styles, because you might prefer step-by-step procedures, while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants to see an example. But regardless of  your own learning preference, everyone benefits from seeing the \\nsame content represented in multiple ways.\\nWe include content for both sides of your brain, because the more of  your brain you \\nengage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of  the brain often means giving the other sid', 'e a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of  time. \\nAnd we included stories and exercises that present more than one point of view, \\nbecause your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make evaluations and \\njudgments. \\nWe included challenges, with exercises, and by asking questions that don’t always have \\na straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to work at \\nsomething. Think about it—you can’t get your body in shape just by watching people at the gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the right things. \\nThat you’re not spending one extra dendrite processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.\\nWe used people.

We deliberately stripped out everything \\nthat might get in the way of  learning whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.\\nWe begin by teaching basic ways of representing and summarizing \\ndata, then move on to probability distributions, and then more advanced techniques such as hypothesis testing.\\nWhile later topics are important, the first thing you need to tackle is fundamental building \\nblocks such as charting, averages, and measures of  variability . So we begin by showing you bas', 'ic statistical problems that you actually solve yourself. That way you can immediately do something with statistics, and you will begin to get excited about it. Then, a bit later in the book, we show you how to use probability and probability distributions. By then you’ll have a solid grasp of  statistics fundamentals, and can focus on learning the concepts. After that, we show you how to apply your knowledge in more powerful ways, such as how to conduct hypothesis tests. We teach you what you need to know at the point you need to know it because that’s when it has the most value.\\nWe cover the same general set of topics that are on the AP and A \\nLevel curriculum.\\nWhile we focus on the overall learning experience rather than exam prep', 'aration, we \\nprovide good coverage of  the AP and A Level curriculum. This means that while you work your way through the topics, you’ll gain the deep understanding you need to get a good grade in whatever exam it is you’re taking.

We can treat each \\ngroup as a separat', 'e category.\\nWe could, but there’s a better way.\\nRather than treat each range of  scores as a separate category , we \\ncan take advantage of  the data being numeric, and present the data \\nusing a continuous numeric scale instead. This means that instead \\nof  using bars to represent a single item, we can use each bar to \\nrepresent a range  of  scores.\\nTo do this, we can create a histogram.\\nHistograms are like bar charts but with two key differences. The \\nfirst is that', 'the area of  each bar is proportional to the frequency , and \\nthe second is that there are no gaps between the bars on the chart. \\nHere’s an example of  a histogram showing the average number of  \\ngames bought per month by households in Statsville:\\nValues are shown on a \\ncontinuous numeric scale.There are no gaps \\nbetween the bars.The area of each \\nbar is proportional \\nto the frequency.\\nfrequency2\\n13\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 -1 6No. Games Bought per Month\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '20  Chapter 1The first step to creating a histogram is to look at each of  the intervals and \\nwork out how wide each of  them needs to be, and what range of  values \\neach one needs to cover. While doing this, we need to make sure that there \\nwill be no gaps between the bars on the histogram.\\nLet’s start with the first two intervals, 0–199 and 200–399. At face value, \\nthe first interval finishes at score 199, and the second starts at score 200. \\nThe problem with plotting it like this, however, is that it would leave a gap \\nbetw', 'een score 199 and 200, like this:Score Frequency\\n0–199 5\\n200–399 29\\n400–599 56\\n600–799 17\\n800–999 3\\nHistograms shouldn’t have gaps between the bars, so to get around this, \\nwe extend their ranges slightly . Instead of  one interval ending at score \\n199 and the next starting at score 200, we make the two intervals meet \\nat 199.5, like this:\\nDoing this forms a single boundary and makes sure that there are no gaps \\nbetween the bars on the histogram.

The advantage of a histogram is that because \\nits numeric, you can use it to show the width of each interval as \\nwell as the frequency.\\nQ:  What about if the intervals are different widths? Can \\nyou still use a histogram?\\nA:  Absolutely. It’s more common for the interval widths to be \\nequal size, but with a histogram they don’t have to be. There \\nare a couple more steps you need to go through to create a \\nhistogram with unequal sized intervals, but we’ll show you that \\nvery soon.\\nQ:  Why shouldn’t histograms have gaps between the \\nbars?\\nA:  There are at least two good reasons. The first is to show \\nthat there are no gaps in the values, and that every value is \\ncovered. The second is so that the width of the interval reflects \\nthe range of the values you’re covering. As an example, if we', 'drew the interval 0–199 as extending from value 0 to value 199, \\nthe width on the chart would only be 199 – 0 = 199.Q:  So why do we make the bars meet midway between \\nthe two?\\nA:  The bars have to meet, and it’s usually at the midway \\npoint, but it all comes down to how you round your values. When \\nyou round values, you normally round them to the nearest whole \\nnumber. This means that the range of values from -0.5 to 0.5 all \\nround to 0, and so when we show 0 on a histogram, we show it \\nusing the range of values from -0.5 to 0.5.\\nQ:  Are there any exceptions to this?\\nA:  Yes, age is one exception. If you have to represent the age \\nrange 18–19 on a histogram, you would normally represent this \\nusing an interval that goes from 18 to 20. The reason for this is \\nthat we typically classify someone as being 19, for example, up \\nuntil their 20th birthday. In effect, we round ages down.\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '24  Chapter 1\\nHours Frequency\\n0–1 4,300\\n1–3 6,900\\n3–5 4,900\\n5–10 2,000\\n10–24 2,100This is the number of \\nhours people play forManic Mango needs another chart\\nThe CEO is very pleased with the histogram you’ve created for him—so \\nmuch so, that he wants you to create another histogram for him.

With grouped \\ndata, we need a visual way of expressing the width of each \\ngroup and also its frequency. Changing the width of the bars is \\nan intuitive way of reflecting the group range, but it has the side \\neffect of making some of the bar sizes look disproportionate.   \\nAdjusting the bar height and using the area to represent \\nfrequency is a way around this.

As an example, if  we want to find the mean of  \\nthe Power Workout class, we first have to add the ages of  all the \\nclass attendees together.\\nThe problem statisticians have is how to generalize this.

If  we could only generalize this, we’d have a \\nway of  showing the calculation without rewriting it every time the \\nclass changes.\\nStatisticians get around this problem by using letters  to represent \\nnumbers . As an example, they might use the letter x to represent \\nages in the Power Workout class like this:\\nSpecific ages of class attendees\\n 19  20  20  20  21General ages of class attendees\\n x1  x2  x3  x4  x5\\nEach x represents the age of  a separate person in the class.

We can \\ndo this by , quite literally , taking the middle value. This is a different \\nsort of  average, and it’s called the median.\\nTo find the median of  the Kung Fu class, line up all the ages in \\nascending order, and then pick the middle value, like', 'this:\\n19 19\\n 20 20 20 21 21 100 102\\nHere’s the number in the \\nmiddle. This is the median, 20.\\nIf  you line all the ages up in ascending order, the value 20 is exactly \\nhalfway along. Therefore, the median of  the Kung Fu class is 20.\\nWhat if  there had been an even number of  people in the class?\\n19 20 20 20 21 21 100 102\\nIf there’s an even number of \\npeople in the class, there will \\nbe no single middle number.\\nIf  you have an even set of  numbers,', 'just take the mean of  the two \\nmiddle numbers  (add them together, and divide by 2), and that’s \\nyour median. In this case, the median is 20.5.\\nWe’ve seen that if you have 9 numbers, the median is the number at position \\n5. If you have 8 numbers, it’s the number at position 4.5 (halfway between \\nthe numbers at position 4 and 5). What about if you have n numbers?The median \\nis always in \\nthe middle.\\nIt’s the \\nmiddle value.\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '62  Chapter 2\\nHow to find the median in three steps:\\n1.  Line your numbers up in order, from smallest to largest.\\n2.   If you have an odd number of values, the median is the one \\nin the middle.  If you have n numbers, the middle number is \\nat position ( n + 1) / 2.\\n3.   If you have an even number of values, get the median by \\nadding the two middle ones together and dividing by 2.  \\nYou can find the midpoint by calculating ( n + 1) / 2. The \\ntwo middle numbers are on either side of this point.\\nQ:  Is it still OK to use the mean with skewed data if I really \\nwant to?\\nA:  You can, and people often do. However, in this situation the \\nmean won’t give you the best representation of what a typical value \\nis. You need the median.\\nQ:  You say that, but surely the whole point of the mean is \\nthat it gives a typical value. It’s the average.\\nA:  The b', 'ig danger is that the mean will give a value that doesn’t \\nexist in the data set. Take the Kung Fu class as an example. If you \\nwere to go into the class and pick a person at random, the chances \\nare that person would be around 20 years old because most people \\nin the class are that sort of age. Just going with the mean doesn’t \\ngive you that impression. Finding the median can give you a more \\naccurate perspective on the data.   \\nBut sometimes even the median will give a value that’s not in the \\ndata set, like our example on the previous page. That’s precisely why \\nthere’s more than one sort of average; sometimes you need to use \\ndifferent methods in order to accurately say what a typical value is.Q:  So is the median better than the mean?\\nA:  Sometimes the median is more appropriate than the mean, \\nbut that doesn’t make it better. Most of', 'the time you’ll need to use \\nthe mean because it usually offers significant advantages over the \\nmedian. The mean is more stable when you are sampling data. We’ll \\ncome back to this later in the book.\\nQ:  How do I use the mean or median with categorical data? \\nWhat about examples like the data on page 9 of Chapter 1?\\nA:  You can only find the mean and median of numerical data. \\nDon’t worry, though, there’s another sort of average that deals with \\njust this problem that we’ll explore later on.\\nQ:  I always get right- and left-skewed data mixed up. How do \\nI remember which is which?\\nA:  Skewed data has a “tail” of outliers. To see which direction \\nthe data is skewed in, find the direction the tail is pointing in.

It’s usually denoted by Pk.\\nk%\\nPk Pk is the value k% of the \\nway through your data.\\nPercentile uses\\nEven though the interpercentile range isn’t that commonly used, the \\npercentiles themselves are useful for benchmarking and determining \\nrank or position. They enable you to determine how high a particular \\nvalue is relative to all the others. As an example, suppo', 'se you heard you \\nscored 50 on your statistics test. With just that number by itself, you’d \\nhave no idea how well you’d done relative to anyone else. But if  you \\nwere told that the 90th percentile for the exam was 50, you’d know that \\nyou scored the same as or better than 90% of  the other people.\\n50P90If you scored 50 and knew \\nthat P90 = 50, you’d have \\nbeaten or matched the score \\nof 90% of other people.\\nFinding percentiles \\nYou can find percentiles in a similar way to how you find quartiles.\\nQuartiles are actually a type of  percentile. The lower quartile is P25, \\nand the upper quartile is P75. The median is P50.\\nfrequency\\nscore\\nStatistics test scores\\n First of  all, line all your values up in ascending order. 11\\n To find the position of  the k th percentile out of  n  numbers, \\nstart of f', 'by calculating        .22\\n If  this gives you an integer, then your percentile is halfway \\nbetw een the v\\nalue at position     and the next number \\nalong.

This then gives \\nyou the position of  the percentile. \\nAs an example, if  you have 125 numbers and want to find the 10th \\npercentile, start off  by calculating 10 × 125 ÷ 100. This gives you a \\nvalue of  12.5. Rounding this number up gives you 13, which means \\nthat the 10th percentile is the number at position 13.4Percentile\\nThe kth percentile is the \\nvalue that’s k% of the way through your data.

What is it again?\\nA:  The standard deviation is a way of \\nmeasuring spread.

If the standard deviation is low, values \\ntend to be close to the mean. \\n   Q:  Can the standar', 'd deviation ever be 0?\\nA:  Yes, it can. The standard deviation is \\n0 if all of the values are the same.

With this probability, you can \\nmake no assumptions about whether one \\nof the events has already occurred. You \\nhave to find the probability of both events \\nhappening without making any assumptions. \\n \\nP(A | B) is the probability of event A given \\nevent B. In other words, you make the \\nassumption that event B has occurred, and \\nyou work out the probability of getting A \\nunder this assumption.\\nQ:  So does that mean that P(A | B) is \\njust the same as P(A)?\\nA:  No, they refer to different probabilities. \\nWhen you calculate P(', 'A | B), you have to assume that event B has already happened. When you work out P(A), you can make no \\nsuch assumption. Q:  Is P(A | B) the same as P(B | A)? \\nThey look similar.\\nA:  It’s quite a common mistake, but they \\nare very different probabilities. P(A | B) \\nis the probability of getting event A given \\nevent B has already happened. P(B | A) \\nis the probability of getting event B given \\nevent A occurred. You’re actually finding \\nthe probability of a different event under a \\ndifferent set of assumptions.\\nQ:  Are probability trees better than \\nVenn diagrams?\\nA:  Both diagrams give you a way of \\nvisualizing probabilities, and both have their \\nuses. Venn diagrams are useful for showing \\nbasic probabilities and relationships, while \\nprobability trees are useful if you’re w', 'orking \\nwith conditional probabilities. It all depends what type of problem you need to solve.Q:  Is there a limit to how many sets of \\nbranches you can have on a probability \\ntree?\\nA:  In theory there’s no limit. In practice \\nyou may find that a very large probability \\ntree can become unwieldy, but you may still \\nfind it easier to draw a large probability tree \\nthan work through complex probabilities without it.\\nQ:  If A and B are mutually exclusive, \\nwhat is P(A | B)?\\nA:  If A and B are mutually exclusive, then \\nP(A ∩ B) = 0 and P(A | B) = 0. This makes \\nsense because if A and B are mutually \\nexclusive, it’s impossible for both events \\nto occur. If we assume that event B has \\noccurred, then it’s impossible for event A to \\nhappen, so P(A | B) = 0.\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '166  Chapter 4\\nBad luck!\\nYou placed a bet that the ball would land in an even pocket \\ngiven we’ve been told it’s black.

In other words, it’s \\nimpossible for both events to occur. \\n \\nIf A and B are independent, then the \\noutcome of A has no effect on the outcome \\nof B, and the outcome of B has no effect on \\nthe outcome of A. Their respective outcomes \\nhave no effect on each other.\\nQ:  Do both events have to be \\nindependent? Can one event be independent and the other dependent?\\nA:  No. The two', 'events are independent \\nof each other , so you can’t have two events \\nwhere one is dependent and the other one is \\nindependent.Q:  Are all games on a roulette wheel \\nindependent?

Factorials also come into \\nplay in other branches of mathematics, \\nlike calculus. In general, they’re a useful \\nmath shorthand, and you’ll see the factorial \\nsymbol whenever you’re faced with this sort \\nof multiplication task.  \\nAll the factorial symbol really means is \\n“take all the numbers from n down to 1 and \\nmultiply them together.”\\nQ:  What if I have a value 0?

Each \\nthing you’re arranging is classed as a whole \\nobject. Equally, you can’t have a negative \\nnumber of objects.Q:  Can the result of a factorial ever be \\nan odd number?\\nA:  There are only two occasions where \\nthis can be true, when n is 0 or when n is 1. \\nIn both these cases, n! = 1.   \\nFor all other values of n, n! is even. This is \\nbecause if n is greater than or equal to 2, \\nthe calculation must include the number 2. \\nAny integer multiplied by 2 is even, so this \\nmeans that n! is even if n is greater than or \\nequal to 2.\\nQ:  Calculating factorials for large \\nnumbers seems like a pain. If I want to \\nfind 10!, I have to multiply 10 numbers \\n(10×9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1), and the result \\ngets really big.

Calculating \\n(n - 1)! gives you twice the number of \\narrangements you actually need as it gives \\nyou both clockwise and counterclockwise \\narrangements. Dividing by 2 gives you the \\nright answer.\\nQ:  What if I’m arranging objects in a \\ncircle and absolute position matters?\\nA:  In this case the number of \\narrangements is given by n!.

We’re both very much concerned with choosing a certain number of  objects from a pool. Having said that, I’d say that’s where the similarity ends.\\nHead First: So what makes you different?Combination: Well, for starters we both have very \\ndifferent attitudes. Permutation is very concerned about order, and really cares about the exact order in which objects are picked. Not only does he want to select objects, he wants to arrange them too. I mean, come on!\\nHead First: I take it you don’t?Combination: No w', 'ay! I’m sure permutation \\nshows a lot of  dedication and all that, but quite frankly , life’s too short.

What’s r?\\nA:  P(X = r) means “the probability that X \\nis equal to value r,” where r is the number of \\ntrials we need to get the first success.  \\nIf you wanted to find, say, P(X = 20), you \\ncould substitute r for 20. This would give you \\na quick way of finding the probability.Q:  Why is it the letter r? Why not some \\nother letter?\\nA:  We used the letter r so that we could \\ngeneralize the result for any particular \\nnumber. We could have used practically any \\nother letter,', 'but using r is common.\\nQ:  How can we have a probability \\ndistribution if the number of possibilities \\nis endless?\\nA:  We don’t have  to specify a probability \\ndistribution by physically listing the \\nprobability of every possible outcome. The \\nkey thing is that we need a way of describing  \\nevery possibility, which we can do with a \\nformula for computing the probability. Q:  Wouldn’t Chad’s snowboarding \\nskills eventually improve? Is it realistic to \\nsay the probability of success is 0.2 for \\nevery trial?\\nA:  That may be a fair assumption. But \\nin this problem, Chad is truly hapless when it comes to snowboarding, and we have to \\nassume that his skills won’t  improve—which \\nmeans his probability of success on the \\nslopes will follow the geometric distribution.(r - 1) failures and 1 success. \\nIn our case, p = 0.2 and  \\nq = 0.8.The probability distribution can be represented algebraically\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '278  Chapter 7P(X = r) = p q r - 1Let’s use the variable X to represent the number of  trials needed to \\nget the first successful outcome—in other words, the number of  trials \\nneeded for the event we’re interested in to happen.\\nTo find the probability of  X taking a particular value r , you can get a quick \\nresult by using: You run a series of\\n independent trials. 11\\n There can be either a success or failure for each trial, and the \\nprobability of  success is the same for each trial.22\\n The main thing you’re interested in is how many trials are needed in \\norder to get the first successful outcome.33\\nwhere p  is the probability of  success, an', 'd q = 1 – p, the probability of  failure. \\nIn other words, to get a success on the r th attempt, there must first have been \\n(r – 1) failures.So if  you have a situation that matches this set of  criteria, you can use the \\ngeometric distribution to help you take a few shortcuts. The important thing \\nto be aware of  is that we use the word “success” to mean that the event \\nwe’re interested in happens. If  we’re looking for an event that has negative \\nconnotations, in statistical terms it’s still counted as a success.\\nThe geometric distribution has a distinctive shape. \\nP(X = r) is at its highest when r = 1, and it gets lower and \\nlower as r inc', 'reases. Notice that the probability of  getting \\na success is highest for the first trial. This means that the \\nmode of  any geometric distribution is always 1, \\nas this is the value with the highest probability . \\nThis may sound counterintuitive, but it’s most likely that \\nonly one attempt will be needed for a successful outcome.Geometric Distribution Up Close\\nWe said that Chad’s snowboarding exploits are an example of  the geometric \\ndistribution.

This means that\\nIf  a variable X follows a geometric distribution where the probability of  \\nsuccess in a trial is p, this can be written asAs well as finding exact probabilities for the geometric distribution, there’s also \\na quick way of  finding probabilities that deal wi', 'th inequalities.\\nLet’s start with P(X > r).\\nP(X > r) is the probability that more than r trials will be needed in order to get \\nthe first successful outcome. In order for more than r  trials to be needed, this \\nmeans that the first r  trials must have ended in failure. This means that you \\nfind the probability by multiplying the probability of  failure together r  times.\\nFor the number of trials needed for a success to be greater \\nthan r, there must have been r failures.\\n P(X  r) + P(X > r) = 1\\nor\\n P(X  r) = 1 - P(X > r)\\nThis gives usThis is because P(X ≤ r) is the opposit', 'e of P(X > r). \\nP(X ≤ r) = 1 - P(X > r).\\nThis is a quick way of saying “X follows a geometric \\ndistribution where the probability of success is p.”\\nI’m getting bruised!

The difference between \\nthem lies in what you actually need to find \\nout, and this dictates which probability \\ndistribution you need to use.   \\nIf you have a fixed number of trials and you \\nwant to know the probability of getting a \\ncertain number of successes, you need to \\nuse the binomial distribution.

Does the binomial distribution?\\nA:  Yes, it does. The mode of a probability \\ndistribution is the value with the highest \\nprobability. If p is 0.5 and n is even, the \\nmode is np. If p is 0.5 and n is odd it has two modes, the two values either side of np.

Does the probability of success \\nhave to be the same for each trial?\\nA:  In order for the geometric or binomial \\ndistribution to be applicable, the probability \\nof success in each trial must be the same. \\nIf it’s not, then neither the geometric nor \\nbinomial distribution is appropriate.Q:  I’ve tried calculating E(X) and \\nit’s not a value that’s in the probability \\ndistribution.

Let’s look at an \\nexample:  \\nSuppose you wanted a piece of string that’s \\n10 inches long to the nearest inch.

What you’re really talking \\nabout is the probability that you have a \\nprecise value to an infinite number of \\ndecimal places .  \\nIf we go back to the string length example, \\nwhat would happen if you needed a piece \\nof string exactly 10 inches long? You would \\nneed to have a length of string measuring \\n10 inches long to the nearest atom and \\nexamined under a powerful microscope.    \\nThe probability of the string being precisely \\n10 inches long is virtually impossible.\\nQ:  But I’m sure that degree of \\naccuracy isn’t needed.

If \\nyou hear someone talking about a Gaussian \\ndistribution, they’re talking about the same \\nthing as the normal distribution.\\nQ:  Are all normal probability tables the \\nsame?\\nA:  All normal probability tables give the \\nsame probabilities for your values. However, \\nthere’s some variation between tables as to \\nwhat’s actually covered by them.\\nQ:  Variation? What do you mean?\\nA:  Some tables and exam boards use \\ndifferent degrees of accuracy in their \\nprobability tables. Also, some show the \\ntables in a slightly different format, but still \\ngive the same information.\\nQ:  So what should I do if I’m taking a \\nstatistics exam?\\nA:  First of all, check what format of \\nprobability table will be available to you while \\nyou’re sitting the exam.

How do I do it?\\nA:  The big thing here is to think about \\nhow you can get the area you want using \\nthe probability tables. Probability tables \\ngenerally only give probabilities in the form \\nP(Z < z) where z is some value. The big trick, \\nthen, is to rewrite your probability only in these terms.  \\nIf you’re dealing with a probability in the form \\nP(a < Z < b)—that is, some sort of range— \\nyou’ll have two probabilities to look up, one \\nfor P(Z < a) and the other for P(Z < b). Once \\nyou have these probabilities, subtract the \\nsmallest from the largest.\\nQ:  Do continuous distributions have \\na mode? Can you find the mode of the \\nnormal distribution?\\nA:  Yes. The mode of a continuous \\nprobability distribution is the value where \\nthe probability density is highest. If you draw the probability density, it’s the value of the \\nhighest point of the curve.  \\nIf you look at the curve of the normal \\ndistribution, the highest point is in the middle.  \\nThe mode of the normal distribution is μ.  \\n       Q:  What about the median?', 'A:  The median of a continuous probability \\ndistribution is the value a where  \\nP(X < a) = 0.5.  In other words, it’s the value \\nthat area of the probability density curve in \\nhalf.  \\nFor the normal distribution, the median is \\nalso μ. The median and mode don’t get used \\nmuch when we’re dealing with continuous \\nprobability distributions. Expectation and \\nvariance are more important.\\nQ:  What’s a standard score?\\nA:  The standard score of a variable is \\nwhat you get if you subtract its mean and \\ndivide by its standard deviation. It’s a way \\nof standardizing normal distributions so \\nthat they are transformed into a N(0, 1) \\ndistribution, and that gives you a way of \\ncomparing them.

Is 4X appropriate for describing the probability \\ndistribution for the weight of  4 people?\\nThe distribution of  4X is actually a linear transform of  X. It’s a \\ntransformation of  X in the form aX + b, where a is equal to 4, and b is equal \\nto 0. This is exactly the same sort of  transform as we encountered earlier with \\ndiscrete probability distributions.\\nLinear transforms describe underlying changes to the size of  the values in the \\nprobability distribution. This means that 4X actually describes the weight of  \\nan individual adult whose weight', 'has been multiplied by 4.\\nSo what’s the distribution of a linear transform?\\nSuppose you have a linear transform of  X in the form aX + b, where  \\nX ~ N(μ, σ2). As X is distributed normally , this means that aX + b is distributed \\nnormally too. But what’s the expectation and variance?\\nLet’s start with the expectation. When we looked at discrete probability \\ndistributions, we found that E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b. Now, X follows a normal distribution where E(X) = μ, so this gives us E(aX + b) = aμ + b.\\nWe can take a similar approach with the variance. When we looked at discrete \\nprobability distributions, we found that Var(aX + b) = a\\n2 Var(X). We know that \\nVar(X) in th', 'is case is given by Var(X) = σ2, so this means that Var(aX + b) = a2σ2. \\nPutting both of  these together gives us\\naX + b ~ N(aμ + b, a2σ2)The new variance is the SQUARE \\nof a multiplied by the original \\nvariance.\\nIn other words, the new mean becomes aμ + b, and the new variance becomes a2σ2.\\nSo what about independent observations?\\n1X 2X 4XThe 4X probability \\ndistribution describes \\nadults whose weights have \\nbeen multiplied by 4.

As \\nan example, if you have a length of rope of \\na particular length, then applying a linear \\ntransform affects the length of the rope.  \\nIndependent observations have to do with \\nthe quantity of things you’re dealing with. \\nAs an example, if you have n', 'independent \\nobservations of a piece of rope, then you’re \\ntalking about n pieces of rope. \\n \\nIn general, if the quantity changes, you’re \\ndealing with independent observations.

What difference does it make?\\nA:  You have to know which is which \\nbecause it make a difference in your \\nprobability calculations. You calculate \\nthe expectation for linear transforms and \\nindependent observations in the same \\nway, but there’s a big difference in the way the variance is calculated.

The discrete value 6 actually covers a range from 5.5 to 6.5, so instead of  \\nusing the normal distribution to find P(X < 6), we should have tried calculating  \\nP(X < 5.5) instead.\\nThis adjustment is called a continuity correction. A continuity correction is the small \\nadjustment that needs to be made when you translate discrete values onto a continuous scale.The binomial is discrete, but the normal is continuous\\nWe didn’t include this area when we calculated \\nP(X < 6) using the binomial distribution, but we \\ndid when we calculated P(X < 6) using the normal \\ndistribution.\\n0.1\\n0.50.15\\n1 2 3 4 5 60.20\\n7 8 9 10 11\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '396  WHO WANTS TO WIN A SWIVEL CHAIRLet’s try finding P(X < 5.5) where X ~ N(6, 3), and see how good an approximation \\nthis is for the probability of  getting five or fewer questions correct.

As you’ve seen, small \\nchanges in the probability range you choose can lead to significant errors in the actual \\nprobabilities. This might not sound like too big a deal, but using the wrong probability \\ncould lead to you making the wrong decisions. \\nLet’s take a look at the kinds of  continuity corrections you need to make for different \\ntypes of  probability problems.\\nFinding ≤ probabilities\\nWhen you work with prob', 'abilities of  the form P(X ≤ a ), the key thing you \\nneed to make sure of  is that you choose your range so that it includes the \\ndiscrete value a . On a continuous scale, the discrete value a goes up to  \\n(a + 0.5). This means that if  you’re using the normal distribution to find  \\nP(X ≤ a ), you actually need to calculate P(X < a  + 0.5) to come up with a \\ngood approximation. In other words, you add an extra 0.5.\\nFinding “between” probabilities\\nProbabilities of  the form P(a  ≤ X ≤ b ) need continuity corrections to make \\nsure that both a  and b  are included. To do this, we need to extend the range \\nout by 0.5 either side. To approximate this probability using t', 'he normal \\ndistribution, we need to find P(a  - 0.5 < X < b  + 0.5). This is really just a \\ncombination of  the two types above.3.5\\n7 8 9 10 11\\n8.5\\nFinding ≥ probabilities\\nIf  you need to find probabilities of  the form P(X ≥ b ), you need to make \\nabsolutely sure that your range includes the discrete value b. The value b \\nextends down to (b  - 0.5) on a continuous scale so you need to use a range of  \\nP(X > b  - 0.5) to make sure that you include it. In other words, you need to \\nsubtract an extra 0.5.This time, we subtract \\n0.5 and use P(X > 8.5) \\nto find P(X > 9).\\nWe use P(1.5 < X < 3.5) \\nto find P(2 < X < 3).Continuity Corrections Up Close\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '398  WHO WANTS TO WIN A SWIVEL CHAIRQ:  Does it really save time to \\napproximate the binomial distribution \\nwith the normal?\\nA:  It can save a lot of time. Calculating \\nbinomial probabilities can be time-consuming \\nbecause you generally have to work out the \\nprobability of lots of different values. You \\nhave no way of simply calculating binomial \\nprobabilities over a range of values.  \\nIf you approximate the binomial distribution \\nwith the normal distribution, then it’s a lot \\nquicker. You can look probabilities up in \\nstandard tables and also deal with whole \\nranges at once.\\nQ:  So is it really accurate?\\nA: Yes, It’s accurate enough for most \\npurposes. The key thing to remember is that \\nyou need to apply a', 'continuity correction. \\nIf you don’t then your results will be less \\naccurate.Q:  What about continuity corrections \\nfor < and >? Do I treat those the same \\nway as the ones for ≤ and ≥?\\nA:  There’s a difference, and it all comes \\ndown to which values you want to include \\nand exclude.  \\nWhen you’re working out probabilities using \\n≤ and ≥, you need to make sure that you \\ninclude the value in the inequality in your \\nprobability range. So if, say, you need to \\nwork out P(X ≤ 10), you need to make sure \\nyour probability includes the value 10. This \\nmeans you need to consider P(X < 10.5).  \\nWhen you’re working out probabilities using \\n< or >, you need to make sure that you \\nexclude the value in the inequality f', 'rom your \\nprobability range. This means that if you need to work out P(X < 10), you need to \\nmake sure that your probability excludes 10. \\nYou need to consider P(X < 9.5). Q:  You can approximate the binomial \\ndistribution with both the normal and \\nPoisson distributions. Which should I \\nuse?\\nA:  It all depends on your circumstances. \\nIf X ~ B(n, p), then you can use the normal \\ndistribution to approximate the binomial distribution if np > 5 and nq > 5.  \\nYou can use the Poisson distribution to \\napproximate the binomial distribution if  \\nn > 50 and p < 0.1\\nRemember, you need to apply a continuity correction when you \\napproximate the binomial distribution with the normal distribution.\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', 'you are here 4   399\\nPool Puzzle\\nYour job is to take snippets from the \\npool and place them into the blank \\nlines so that you get the right \\ncontinuity correction for each \\nds', 'crete probability range.

I model \\nthat variation.\\nHead First: So why’s that so important?Normal: Well, it means that you can use me to work \\nou', 't probabilities.

How do you mean?Normal: With a lot of  the other probability \\ndistributions, there can be lots of  complicated calculations involved.

For Mighty Gumball, \\na sample of  gumballs means just', 'a small selection of  gumballs rather \\nthan every single one of  them.\\nA study or survey involving just a sample of  the population is called a \\nsample survey. A lot of  the time, conducting a survey is more practical \\nthan a census. It’s usually less time-consuming and expensive, as you don’t \\nhave to deal with the entire population. And because you don’t use the \\nwhole population, taking a sample survey of  the gumballs means that \\nthere’ll be plenty left over when you’re done.Gumball populations\\nAt the moment, Mighty Gumball is carrying out their taste test using every single \\ngumball that they have available. In statistical terms, they are conducting their test \\nusing an entire population.\\nA statistical population refers to the entire group of  things that you’re trying to \\nmeasure, study , or an', 'alyze. It can refer to anything from humans to scores to gumballs. \\nThe key thing is that a population refers to all of  them.\\nA census is a study or survey involving the entire population, so in the case of  Mighty \\nGumball, they’re conducting a census of  their gumball population by tasting every \\nsingle one of  them. A census can provide you with accurate information about your \\npopulation, but it’s not always practical. When populations are large or infinite, it’s \\njust not possible to include every member.\\nSo how can you use samples to find out about a population?

If  your sample is representative, this means it has similar \\ncharacteristics to the population. And this, in turn, means that you can use your \\nsample to predict what characteristics the population will have.\\nSuppose you use a representative sample of  gumballs to test how long the flavor of  \\neach gumball lasts for.

You write the \\nname or number of  each member of  the sampling frame on a piece \\nof  paper or ball, and then place th', 'em all into a container. You then \\ndraw out n  names or numbers at random so that you have enough \\nfor your sample.\\nRandom number generators\\nIf  you have a large sampling frame, drawing lots might not be \\npractical, so an alternative is to use a random number generator, \\nor random number tables.

What do you think \\ncould go wrong with it?\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '432  Chapter 10There are other types of sampling\\nEven simple random sampling has its problems.\\nWith simple random sampling, there’s still a chance that your sample will not \\nrepresent the target population. For example, you might end up randomly \\ndrawing only yellow gumballs for your sample, and the other colors would be left \\nout.\\nSo how can we avoid this?\\nWe can use stratified sampling...\\nAn alternative to simple random sampling is stratified sampling.', 'With this type of  \\nsampling, the population is split into similar groups that share similar characteristics. \\nThese charateristics or groups are called strata, and each individual group is called \\na stratum. As an example, we could split up the gumballs into the different colors, \\nyellow, green, red, and pink, so that each color forms a different stratum.\\nOnce you’ve done this, you can perform simple random sampling on each stratum to \\nensure that each g', 'roup is represented in your overall sample. To do this, look at the \\nproportions of  each stratum within the overall population and take a proportionate \\nnumber from each. As an example, if  50% of  the gumballs that Mighty Gumball \\nproduce are red, half  of  your sample should consist of  red gumballs.\\nEach color is a \\nseparate stratum.\\nWe sample a proportionate \\nnumber from each stratum.stratified, cluster, and systematic sampling\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', 'you are here 4   433using statistical sampling\\n...or we can use cluster sampling...\\nCluster sampling is useful if  the population has a number of  similar \\ngroups or clusters. As an example, gumballs might be sold in packets, \\nwith each packet containing a similar number of  gumballs with similar \\ncolors. Each packet would form a cluster.\\nWith cluster sampling, instead of  taking a simple random sample of  \\nunits, you draw a simple random sample of  clusters , and then \\nsurvey everything within each of  these clusters. As an example, you \\ncould take a simple random sample of  packets  of  gumballs, and then \\ntaste all the gumballs in these packets.\\nCluster sa', 'mpling works because each cluster is similar to the others, \\nand an added advantage is that you don’t need a sampling frame of  \\nthe whole population in order to achieve it. As an example, if  you were \\nsurveying trees and used particular forests as your cluster, you would \\nonly need to know about each tree within only the forests you’d selected.\\nThe problem with cluster sampling is that it might not be entirely \\nrandom. As an example, it’s likely that all of  the gumballs in a packet \\nwill have been produced by the same factory . If  there are differences \\nbetween the factories, you may not pick these up.\\n...or even systematic sampling\\nWith systematic sampli', 'ng, you list the population in some sort of  order, \\nand then survey every k th item, where k  is some number. As an example, \\nyou could choose to sample every 10th gumball.\\nSystematic sampling is relatively quick and easy , but there’s one key \\ndisadvantage. If  there’s some sort of  cyclic pattern in the population, \\nyour sample will be biased. As an example, if  gumballs are produced \\nsuch that every 10th gumball is red, you will end up only sampling red \\ngumballs, and this could lead to you drawing misleading conclusions \\nabout your population.Each packet forms a cluster.\\nYou can pick every 10th gumball to get a systematic sample.\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '434  Chapter 10Q:  Does using one of these methods \\nof sampling guarantee that the sample \\nwon’t be biased?\\nA:  They don’t guarantee  that the sample \\nwon’t be biased, but they do minimize the \\nchances of this happening. By really thinking \\nabout your target population and how you \\ncan make your sample representative of it, \\nyou stand a much better chance of coming \\nup with an unbiased, representative sample.\\nQ:  Do I have to use any of these \\nmethods? Can’t I just choose items at \\nrandom.\\nA:  Choosing items at random is simple \\nrandom sampling. Yes, this is one approach \\nyou can take, but one thing to be aware of is \\nthat there is a chance your sample will not \\nbe representative of the population at large.\\nQ:  But why? Surely if I choose items \\nat random, then my sample is bound to \\nbe representative of the target population.\\nA:  Not necessarily. You see, if you choose \\nsampling units at random, then there’s a \\nchance that purely at random, you could \\nchoose a sample that doesn’t effectively \\nrepresent the target population. As an \\nexample, if you choose customers of the \\nStatsville Health Club completely at random, \\nthere’s a chance that you might choose only \\nattendees of one particular class, or of one \\nparticular gen', 'der.        \\nThere might also be a case where you think \\nyou’re sampling at random, when really \\nyou’re not. As an example, if you conduct a \\nsurvey to find out customer satisfaction, but \\nleave it up to customers whether or not they \\nrespond, you may well end up with a biased \\nsample as customers have to be sufficiently \\nmotivated to respond. The customers who \\nare most motivated to take part in the survey \\nwill be those who are either strongly satisfied \\nor strongly dissatisfied. You are less likely to \\nhear from those customers without strong \\nfeelings, yet those people may make up the \\nbulk of the population.\\nQ:  How about if I just increase the size \\nof my sample? Will that get around bias?\\nA:  The larger your sample, the less \\nchance there is of your sample being \\nbiased, and this is one way of minimizing the \\nchances of getting a biased sample using \\nsimple random sampling. The trouble is, the \\nlarger your sample, the more cumbersome \\nand time-consuming it can be to gather data.\\nQ:  What’s the difference between \\nstratified sampling and clustered sampling?\\nA:  With stratified sampling, you divide \\nthe population into different groups or strata, where all the units within a stratum are as \\nsimilar to each other as p', 'ossible. In other \\nwords, you take some characteristic or \\nproperty such as gender, and use this as the \\nbasis for the strata. Once you’ve split the \\npopulation into strata, you perform simple random sampling on each stratum.   \\nWith clustered sampling, your aim is to \\ndivide the population into clusters, trying to \\nmake the clusters as alike as possible. You \\nthen use simple random sampling to choose \\nclusters, and then sample everything in \\nthose clusters.\\nQ:  I see. So with stratified sampling, \\nyou make each stratum as different as \\npossible, and with clustered sampling, \\nyou make each cluster as similar as \\npossible.\\nA:  Exactly.\\nQ:  So what about systematic \\nsampling?\\nA:  With systematic sampling, you choose \\na number, k, and then choose every kth \\nitem for your sample. This way of sampling \\nis fairly quick and easy, but it doesn’t mean \\nthat your sample will be representative of the population. In fact, this sort of sampling \\ncan only be used effectively if there are no \\nrepetitive patterns or organization in the \\nsampling frame\\nQ:  Drawing lots sounds antiquated. \\nDo people still do that?\\nA:  It’s not as common as it used to be, \\nbut it’s still a way of sampling.there are no dumb questions\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', 'you are here 4   435using statistical sampling\\n1.

It’s specific to the sorts of \\nproblems you have with this distribution. Q:  Is the proportion of the sample the \\nsame as the proportion of the population?\\nA:  The proportion of the sample can be \\nused as a point estimator for the proportion \\nof the population. It’s effectively a best \\nguess as to what the value of the population \\nproportion is.\\nQ:  Is that still the case if the sample', 'is \\nbiased in some way? How do I estimate \\nproportion from a biased sample?\\nA:  The key here is to make sure that \\nyour sample is unbiased, as this is what you \\nbase your estimate on. If your sample is \\nbiased, this means that you will come with \\nan inaccurate estimate for the population \\nproportion. This is the case with other point \\nestimators too.Q:  So how do I make sure my sample \\nis unbiased?\\nA:  Going through the points we \\nraised in the previous chapter is a good \\nway of making sure your sample is as \\nrepresentative as possible.

Why \\ndon’t we substitute in a \\nvalue for μ?\\nWe don’t substi', 'tute in a value for μ as this is what \\nwe’re trying to find a confidence interval for.\\nWe’re using the sampling distribution to help us find a confidence interval \\nfor μ, so this means that we substitute in values for everything except  for μ. \\nBy substituting in the values for σ2 and n, we can use the distribution of  X \\nto help us find the confidence interval. We’ll show you how really soon.\\nThere’s just one problem. We don’t know what the true value of  σ2 is.

Rather \\nthan use σ2, we can use 2 in its place, or s2. \\nThis means that the expectation and variance for the sampli', 'ng \\ndistribution of  means is\\n \\n  E(X) = μ  Var(X) = s2\\n      n\\n \\nMighty Gumball used a sample of  100 gumballs to come up with their \\nestimates, and they have calculated that s2 = 25. This means that\\n \\n  \\n Var(X) = s2\\n     n\\n               =  25\\n     100\\n               = 0.25 \\nThere’s still one thing we have left to do.

As an example, \\nsuppose we want a confidence level of  95% for the population mean. \\nThis means that the probability of  the pop', 'ulation mean being inside the \\nconfidence interval is 0.95. \\nThe confidence level is the probability \\nof the population mean being inside the \\nconfidence interval.

What’s the right \\nlevel of  confidence?\\nThe answer to this really depends on your situation and how confident \\nyou need to be that your interval contains the population statistic. A 95% \\nconfidence level is common, but sometimes you might want a different \\none, such as 90% or 99%. As an example, the Mighty Gumball CEO \\nmight want to have a higher degree of  confidence that the population \\nmean falls inside the confidence interval, as he intends to use it in his \\ntel', 'evision advertisements.\\nThe key thing to remember is that the higher the confidence level is, \\nthe wider the interval becomes, and the more chance there is of  the \\nconfidence interval containing the population statistic.\\nWell, why don’t we just make the \\nconfidence interval really wide? \\nThat way we’re bound to include \\nthe population statistic. \\nThe trouble with making the confidence interval \\ntoo wide is that it can lose meaning.\\nAs an extreme example, we could say that that the mean duration of  \\ngumball flavor is between 0 minutes and 3 days. While this is true, it \\ndo', 'esn’t give you an idea how long gumball flavor really lasts for. You don’t know whether it lasts for seconds, minutes, or hours.\\nThe key thing is to make the interval as narrow as possible, but \\nwide enough so you can be reasonably sure the true mean is in the \\ninterval.\\nLet’s use a 95% confidence level for Mighty Gumball. That way , \\nthere’ll be a high probability that it contains the population mean.\\nNow that we have the confidence level, we can move onto the final step: \\nfinding the confidence limits.\\nHow to select an appropriate confidence level\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '496  Chapter 12\\nStep 4: Find the confidence limits\\nThe final step is to find a and b, the limits of  the confidence interval, \\nwhich indicate the left and right borders of  the range in which there’s \\na 95% probability of  the mean falling. The exact value of  a and b \\ndepends on the sampling distribution we need to use and the level of  \\nconfidence that we need to have.\\nFor this problem, we need to find the 95% confidence level for the mean \\nduration of  gumball flavor.

The stronger you want the evidence to \\nbe, the lower your significance level needs to be.  \\nThe most common significance level is 5%, although you sometimes \\nsee tests at the 1% level. Testing at the 1% means that you require \\nstronger evidence than if you test at the 5% level. \\n  Q:  Does the significance level have anything in common with \\nthe level of confidence for confidence intervals?\\nA:  Yes, they have0 a lot in common. When you construct a \\nconfidence interval for a population parameter, you want to have \\na certain degree of confidence that the population parameter lies \\nbetween two limits. As an example, if you have a 95% level of \\nconfidence, this means that the probability that the population \\nparame', 'ter lies between the two limits is 0.95.  \\nThe level of significance reflects the probability that values will lie \\noutside a certain limit.

It states that almost all of  the values lie within three standard \\ndeviations of  the mean. In particular, \\nChebyshev’s rule for any distribution\\nA similar rule applies to any set of  data called Chebyshev’s rule, or \\nChebyshev’s inequality.

Experiments\\nExperiments are used to test cause and effect relationships between variables. As an \\nexample, an experiment could test the effect of  different doses of  SnoreCull on snorers.\\nIn an experiment, indpendent variables or factors are manipulated so that we can \\nsee the effect on dependent variables. As an example, we might want to examine the \\neffect that different doses of  SnoreCull have on the number of  hours spent snoring in a \\nnight. The doses of  SnoreCull would be the independent variable, and the number of  \\nhours spent snoring would be the dependent variable.\\nThe subjects that you use for your experiment are called experimental units—in this \\ncase, snorers.\\nSo what makes for a good experiment?\\nThere are three basic principles you need to bear in mind when you design an \\nexperiment: controls, randomization, and replication. Just', 'as with sampling, a \\nkey aim is to minimize bias.\\nYou need to control the effects of external influences or natural variability.\\nWhen you conduct an experiment, you need to minimize effects that are not part of  the \\nexperiment. To do this, the first thing is to have a control group, a neutral group that receives \\nno treatments, or only neutral treatments. You can assess the effectiveness of  the treatment by \\ncomparing the results of  your treated groups with the results of  your control group.\\nA placebo is a neutral treatment, one that has no effect on the dependent variable. Sometimes \\nthe subjects of  your experiment can respond differently to having a neutral treatment as opposed \\nto having no treatment at all, so giving a placebo to a group is a way of  controlling this effect. If  the group taking a placebo doesn’t know that it’s a placebo, then this is calle', 'd blinding, and it’s \\ncalled double blinding if  even those administering the treatments don’t know.\\nYou need to assign subjects to treatments at random.\\nYou’ll see more about this on the next page.\\nYou need to replicate treatments.\\nEach treatment should be given to many subjects. You need to use many snorers per treatment to \\ngauge the effects, not just one snorer.\\nAnother factor to be aware of  is confounding. Confounding occurs when the \\ncontrols in an experiment don’t eliminate other possible causes for the effect on the \\ndependent variable. As an example, imagine if  you gave doses to SnoreCull to men, \\nbut placebos to women. If  you compared the results of  the two groups, you wouldn’t be able to tell whether the effect on the men was because of  the drug, or because one \\ngender naturally snores more than another.\\nconducting experiments\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', 'you are here 4   647leftovers\\nDesigning your experiment\\nWe said earlier that you need to randomly assign subjects to experiments. But what’s \\nthe best way of  doing this?\\nCompletely randomized design\\nOne option is to use a completely randomized design. For \\nthis, you literally assign treatments to subjects at random. If  \\nwe were to conduct an experiment testing the effect of  doses \\nof  SnoreCull on snorers, we would randomly assign snorers to \\nparticular treatment groups. As an example, we could give half  \\nof  the snorers a placebo and the other half  a single dose of  \\nSnoreCull.\\nCompletely randomized design is similar to simple random \\nsampling. Instead of  choosing a sample at random, you assign \\ntreatments at random.\\nRandomized block design\\nAnother option is to use randomized block design . For \\nthis, you', 'divide the subjects into similar groups, or blocks. \\nAs an example, you could split the snorers into males and \\nfemales. Within each block, you assign treatments at random, \\nso for each gender, you could give half  the snorers a dose of  \\nSnoreCull and give the other half  a placebo. The aim of  this \\nis to minimize confounding, as it reduces the effect of  gender.\\nRandomized block design is similar to stratified random \\nsampling. Instead of  splitting your population into strata, you \\nsplit your subjects into blocks.\\nMatched pairs design\\nMatched pairs design is a special case of  randomized \\nblock design. You can use it when there are only two \\ntreatment conditions and subjects can be grouped into like \\npairs. As an example, the SnoreCull experiment could have \\ntwo treatment conditions, to give a placebo or to', 'give a \\nsingle dose, and snorers could be grouped into similar pairs \\naccording to gender and age. You then give one of  each \\npair a placebo, and the other a dose of  SnoreCull. If  one pair consisted of  two men aged 30, for instance, you would \\ngive one of  the men a placebo and the other man a dose of  \\nSnoreCull.Placebo SnoreCull\\n500 500\\nIf there were 1,000 subjects, we \\ncould give half a placebo and the \\nother half a dose of SnoreCull\\nPlacebo SnoreCull\\nMale 250 250\\nFemale 250 250\\nIf there were 500 men and 500 \\nwomen, we could give half of each \\ngender a placebo and the other \\nhalf a dose of SnoreCull\\nPlacebo SnoreCull\\nMale 30 1 1\\nMale 30 1 1\\nFemale 30 1 1\\nFemale 30 1 1\\n... ... ...\\nYou could also form matched pairs using \\ngender and age to negate confounding due to \\nthese variables.\\nDownload at WoweBook.Com', '648  Appendix iIn Chapter 15 you saw how a least squares regression line takes the \\nform y = a + bx, where\\n \\n  \\n b = Σ(x - x)(y - y)\\n  \\n            Σ(x - x)2 \\nThere’s another form of  writing this that a lot of  people find easier to \\nremember, and that’s to rewrite it in terms of  variances.
